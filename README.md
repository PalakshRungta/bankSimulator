The following code replicates the tasks performed by a virtual banking service.  With this code, a user could:  1. Create a new Savings Account 2. Access an existing Savings Account 3. Delete an existing Savings Account  If the user opts to create a new savings account, the code will ask the user to input their name and an initial deposit amount. The user is then given a 5-digit account number generated by the code, that is essential to accessing the account later.  The user data (Name, Amount, and Account Number) is stored in an external file called 'AccountInfo.txt' in the form of a nested dictionary.  The user could also opt to access their savings account. This is done by asking the user to input their registered name and account number. Giving the right information enables them to:  1. Withdraw money 2. Deposit money 3. Display current Balance  The code accesses and updates the user data in all cases.  Finally, the user can opt to delete their existing savings account by inputting their registered name and account number. The code will find the user data, and delete it from the dictionary, hence deleting the savings account.  The code can access and update user data even if the program is quit, as the data is stored in an external file ('AccountInfo.txt').
